### What I learned

I learn more about how to use the tools(npm,tailwind-cli,etc..) from installation up to its documentation. From the design itself, the challenging part is the hover state img where it took me some time to figure out how would I do it. So, I reach out to stackoverflow, asked help about my problem and lucky enough to have someone knows how to it. This code snippet below help me achieved it: 

```html
  <div class="w-full rounded-md bg-cover bg-center bg-[url('../images/image-equilibrium.jpg')]">
    <div class="w-full rounded-md bg-blue-1100 opacity-0 hover:opacity-70 transition duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer">
      <div class="flex justify-center items-center h-72">
        <img src="../images/icon-view.svg" alt="">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

### Useful resources
