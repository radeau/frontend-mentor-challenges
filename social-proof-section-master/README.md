## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this challenge, I was able to apply grids and flex concept although I have yet to improve on how and when to use it. The background property is also a concept that takes me time to figure out how to apply but its simple as snippet below:

```css
body {
    background: url(./images/bg-pattern-top-desktop.svg), url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom-desktop.svg) bottom right;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
### Continued development

I am currently taking the responsive layout course of Kevin Powell as I have to improve my knowledge on this concept. 

### Useful resources

- [Grids:Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) - MDN really helped me a lot on Grid & Flex concept. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for many reason. It's easy to understand with the visual aids and code snippets and I really liked the pattern and will use it going forward.

- [HTML and CSS Guide](https://frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand syntax of HTML and CSS.
